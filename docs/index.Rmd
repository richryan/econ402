# Basic course spiel

The goal of this section is to help you earn a good grade in ECON 402.
A large part of ECON 402's _raison d'&ecirc;tr_ is teaching you _actual_ economics,
so I'll also try to incorporate a few topics (mostly nifty stuff you can do with computers) that will likely form the basis of your future research and/or what will come up in job interviews.
But those topics will just be for fun.

I encourage you to attend all sections and office hours.
Please speak up if a topic needs more consideration.
And please laugh at all my jokes.

# Resources

While the class is largely self-contained,
Professor House mentioned that he may at times reference material from ECON 401.
Occasionally I may want to reference 401-type material or finance-related material.
I will do so, mostly, by referring to notes that I wrote as a GSI for ECON 401 and 435.
These notes are available here:

* [ECON 401](https://richryan.github.io/notes/#intermediate-microeconomic-theory-econ-401)
* [ECON 435](https://richryan.github.io/notes/#financial-economics-econ-435)

The past year and a half I was a GSI for the first-year macro sequence in the PhD program.
Those notes are also cataloged there.
We'll be covering some of the same topics in this class, 
in case you're interested in a more math-y presentation.

# Warning

In the interests of full and forthright disclosure,
I really really really like macroeconomics.
Any economic evangelism is only meant in jest or to signal what I think is useful to know (like for exams).
We're going to learn a lot and have lots of fun this semester.
