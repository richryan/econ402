<!-- ## Section notes -->
Section notes for ECON 402, Intermediate Macroeconomics, with Professor [Chris House](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~chouse/)

## 1 A too short introduction
Plotting, two-period budget constraints, comparative statics with the intertemporal budget constraint, agents can always consume their endowment, not being allowed to borrow, indifference curves, derivatives, [optimization](https://umich.box.com/s/t3pnjnvzwyiz861fgoabc5glg91vgw1y)

## 2 Intertemporal choice, the saving supply function, dynamic general equilibrium
Here are the notes for [section 2](https://umich.box.com/s/03fuxxit457y7lfas2ti79u5lobmzzye).
A few take-aways:

+ Intertemporal choice lead to the consumption Euler equation: $\text{MU}(c_1) = (1+r) \text{MU}(c_2)$.
+ The saving supply function: $s_1(r,y) := y_1 - c_1(r,y)$.
We plotted the saving supply function for both 
    * log utility and 
    * linear utility.
+ Dynamic general equilibrium.
Definition 2.2 defines our notation of equilibrium, which is important&mdash;see slide 17 of _Lecture 4\_handouts_.
From national accounting, we saw that $Y = C$ for the endowment economies we explored.
Therefore aggregate saving was $0$.
This equilibrium market-clearing condition provides a procedure for computing equilibrium levels of consumption and the equilibrium interest rate:
    1. Compute the demand functions, $c(r,y)$. Since income is exogenous, these are simply functions of the interest rate.
    2. Using the demand functions, calculate the saving functions.
    3. In equilibrium, the interest rate (price) must adjust so that aggregate saving is $0$. With the interest rate in hand, equilibrium levels of consumption and saving can be read off of items 1. and 2.
